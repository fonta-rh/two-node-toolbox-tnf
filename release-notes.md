# Two-Node Toolbox Release Notes

## Version 0.5 - Instance and Cluster Lifecycle Management
*Release Date: July 2025*

### New Features

#### Instance and Cluster Lifecycle Management
- Added EC2 instance start/stop capabilities with OpenShift cluster detection
- Instance operations detect running OpenShift clusters and provide management options
- Interactive prompts guide users through cluster shutdown/startup procedures

#### Cluster Deployment Options
- New `make redeploy-cluster` command with deployment strategy detection
- Automatic detection of cluster topology changes (Arbiter â†” Fencing) with cleanup strategies
- Deployment paths optimized based on cluster state and configuration changes

#### Cluster Cleanup Management
- Simplified cluster cleanup with `make clean` and `make full-clean` commands
- Standardized cleanup interface replacing direct ansible playbook commands
- Documentation updated to recommend make targets over manual ansible commands

### New Commands

- **Breaking Change**: All make commands now run from `deploy/` directory instead of `deploy/aws-hypervisor/`


#### Instance Management
- `make create` - Create new EC2 instance (renamed from `deploy`)
- `make start` - Start stopped EC2 instance with cluster detection
- `make stop` - Interactive stop with cluster management options  
- `make redeploy-cluster` - Cluster redeployment with mode selection
- `make shutdown-cluster` - Graceful OpenShift cluster VM shutdown
- `make startup-cluster` - Restore OpenShift cluster VMs and proxy services

#### Cluster Cleanup Management
- `make clean` - Standard cluster cleanup preserving cached data for faster redeployment
- `make full-clean` - Complete cluster cleanup including all cached data for thorough reset

#### Workflow Scripts
- Stop script detects running clusters and offers shutdown, cleanup, or redeploy options, with separate force-stop command
- Cluster state tracking maintains configuration state for recovery
- Automatic proxy container lifecycle management during cluster operations

### Technical Changes

- Cluster VM state tracking for startup/shutdown cycles
- Updated .gitignore for inventory backups and config files
- Reorganized Makefile with comprehensive command structure and help system
- Deployment selection between fast redeploy, clean deployment, and complete rebuild
- Enhanced Ansible playbook integration for redeploy workflows

### Documentation Restructuring

- Split README documentation: makefile commands documented in `deploy/README.md`
- AWS hypervisor scripts documented separately in `deploy/aws-hypervisor/README.md`

### Migration Notes

**For existing users**: Change your working directory from `deploy/aws-hypervisor/` to `deploy/` when running make commands:

```bash
# Old workflow
cd deploy/aws-hypervisor
make deploy

# New workflow  
cd deploy
make deploy
```

- Separate config files for arbiter (`config_arbiter.sh`) and fencing (`config_fencing.sh`) deployments
- Reorganized roles for clarity and maintainability

### Documentation

- TNF documentation explaining Two-Node with Fencing concepts, Pacemaker integration, and use cases
- Updated Two-Node with Arbiter documentation  
- Added visual topology diagrams for both TNA and TNF configurations

## Project Overview

The Two-Node Toolbox provides tooling for deploying and managing two-node OpenShift clusters in development environments. It supports both Two-Node Arbiter (TNA) and Two-Node with Fencing (TNF) topologies for High Availability solutions in edge computing and development scenarios.

### Supported Topologies

- **Two-Node with Arbiter (TNA)**: 2 full control planes + 1 arbiter node
- **Two-Node with Fencing (TNF)**: 2 control planes + software-based fencing via Pacemaker/Corosync

### Use Cases

- Edge computing deployments requiring HA
- Development and testing environments  
- CI/CD integration for cluster lifecycle testing
- Prototyping and validation workflows

**Note**: Two-node configurations are Technology Preview features and not covered under Red Hat production SLAs. Primarily targets OpenShift 4.19+ deployments on bare metal infrastructure.
